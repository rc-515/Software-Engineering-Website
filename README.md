# Software-Engineering-Website
Group Members: Rowan Cahill and Alex Glotzer

Repo contains: An index.html file which serves as the landing page, an indexStyle.css file which is the styling for the landing page, a SignUp.html file which houses the signup form, a SignUpStyle.css file which is the styling for the signup and login pages, and an images folder which has the files for the images that appear on the website. We also have the readme, license, and .gitignore. terms.html contains the terms and conditions.
As of Friday, March 7, at 10:00 AM, the repo now also contains a login.php, which allows users to access their dashboard in dashboard.html, and a logout.php, which gives a logout page. db_implement.php manages the database of emails, passwords, and other information. CRUD is implemented to manage users with Create: add_match.php, Read: view_matches.php, Update: edit_match.php, and Delete: delete_match.php. register.php signs a user up.

Once logging in, there is an algorithm which, with enough users of similar attributes, will match a user to close counterparts to fight. If there are no closely matching users, it will tell the user there are no available fights. 

The Website is implemented using InfinityFree: fightclubcomp333.infinityfreeapp.com

We consulted ChatGPT for help with understanding HTML and CSS, as well as debugging php files.
